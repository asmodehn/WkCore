/// Fast mutex class.
/// This is a mutual exclusion object for synchronizing access to shared
/// memory areas for several threads. It is similar to the tthread::mutex class,
/// but instead of using system level functions, it is implemented as an atomic
/// spin lock with very low CPU overhead.
///
/// The \c fast_mutex class is NOT compatible with the \c condition_variable
/// class (however, it IS compatible with the \c lock_guard class). It should
/// also be noted that the \c fast_mutex class typically does not provide
/// as accurate thread scheduling as a the standard \c mutex class does.
///
/// Because of the limitations of the class, it should only be used in
/// situations where the mutex needs to be locked/unlocked very frequently.
///
/// @note The "fast" version of this class relies on inline assembler language,
/// which is currently only supported for 32/64-bit Intel x86/AMD64 and
/// PowerPC architectures on a limited number of compilers (GNU g++ and MS
/// Visual C++).
/// For other architectures/compilers, system functions are used instead.

C is widely used and has a lots of different implementation on different platforms.
WkCore library fills the missing space in C++ to use the old C calls in a new "C++" way.

WkCore aim to be completely cross-platform and portable on any system, with any compiler.
It can also sometime provide implementation of recent feature in old standard with old compilers.
